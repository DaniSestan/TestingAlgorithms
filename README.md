# Testing Algorithms in Python

## Description
**Status:** In Progress

This is a new, smaller project I've created for my own reference. Working on this to sharpen my Python skills by testing different algorithms ranging from simple to complex, and by measuring algorithmic efficiency.

---

### Exercises

**01_basic_algorithms:** simple program using binary search, basic performance timing, (deterministic) brute force algorithm, pure random algorithm

**02_algorithmic_efficiency:** testing understanding of algorithmic efficiency; solving algorithms with straightforward algebraic operations, as well as more complex manipulations, such as Stirling's Approximation. End result is printed to html file, displaying a table that returns comparisons of running times.

Problem: For each function _f(n)_ and the time _t_, evaluate the largest size n of problem that can be solved in time _t_, assuming that the algorithm to solve the problem takes _f(n)_ microseconds.

Functions _f(n)_: log<sub>2</sub>_n_, âˆš_n_, _n_, _n_ log<sub>2</sub> _n_, _n_<sup>2</sup>, _n_<sup>3</sup>, 2<sup>_n_</sup>, and _n_! 

Time periods: 1 second, 1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day, 1 month, 1 year, 1 century

**03_insertion_and_merge_sort**: Writing small function for time efficiency -- to be used measuring execution times of both insertion and merge sorting algorithms. Will be testing with included data files. Computing and displaying total number of comparisons to complete each sorting algorithm, and time efficiencies.
