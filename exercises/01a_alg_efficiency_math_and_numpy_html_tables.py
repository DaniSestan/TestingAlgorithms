# Program Plan:

# Try referencing the 'Comparison of Running Times' problem. I'm assuming there's exactly 30 days/month for this problem.
# Consider using 'scipy', 'numpy', 'math', or any other modules to solve this.
# The output will be in a HTML text format which includes a table with the responses. Use any HTML library module or simple print() or write() functions to write my html file. When the file is loaded on a browser, it should display a table in a reasonably nice table format looking like the one in the textbook.
